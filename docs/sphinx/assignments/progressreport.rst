----

In complete sentences and coherent paragraphs, create the following sections. Do not rely excessively on point or list form. Double space your work and use a size 12 font. Ensure your status report is no longer than 4 sheets of paper (including the cover page). This means 3 pages of text. If status reports are longer, we will throw out the extra pages -- these will not be graded.

**Introduction**

Provide a brief description of your project in which you explain its objectives, the significance of these objectives, and any relevant history of the project. If it is a continuation or extension of a previous project, explain how your current work is a part of it. If it is a group project, identify the other students involved. Conclude this section by describing what you hope to have accomplished and learned by the end of the project.

Note: in the following sections, if you are working in a group, you must describe both your own work and that of the other members in your group.
Work Completed:

    * Describe what has been accomplished to date
    * Explain any difficulties that have arisen
    * Explain how they have been dealt with

**Work in Progress**

    * Describe what you are currently doing
    * Explain any difficulties you are currently facing
    * Explain how you are dealing with them

**Work Remaining**

    * Describe what remains to be done
    * Forecast any potential difficulties
    * Explain how you will deal with them

**Conclusion**

    * Evaluate your performance so far
    * Describe whether you are confident or concerned about the project as a whole so far and why
    * Indicate that the project will be completed on time
