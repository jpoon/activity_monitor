----

In complete sentences and coherent paragraphs, create the following sections. Do not rely excessively on point or list form. Double space your work and use a size 12 font. Ensure your status report is no longer than 4 sheets of paper (including the cover page). This means 3 pages of text. If status reports are longer, we will throw out the extra pages -- these will not be graded.

**Introduction**

Under the guidance of Professor S. Gopalakrishnan, I have been developing a system capable of monitoring various activities via several sensor nodes attached to the body.
With the usage of such a system, it is then possible to monitor an individual's activities and, in scenario that the system detects a fall, it can automatically notify the authorities (e.g. caregiver) such that they can immediately respond to the situation.
The project progress is outlined below.

Provide a brief description of your project in which you explain its objectives, the significance of these objectives, and any relevant history of the project. If it is a continuation or extension of a previous project, explain how your current work is a part of it. If it is a group project, identify the other students involved. Conclude this section by describing what you hope to have accomplished and learned by the end of the project.

Note: in the following sections, if you are working in a group, you must describe both your own work and that of the other members in your group.
