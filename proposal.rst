PROJECT PROPOSAL
Producing the individual formal project proposal is your first task. This is not supposed to be a timewasting bureaucratic effort but primarily an aid to you, possibly only a page or two in length. It allows you to think about what you can really achieve in the limited time available. The proposal should describe the objectives and specific tasks of the project, bearing in mind the course description "Project in electrical engineering or computer engineering involving design, experimental and/or computer simulation work". If you are part of a project team, ensure that your project description makes this point clear and that you describe your group's organisation and the specific tasks of all your group members. Include a Gantt chart that shows how you intend to schedule your time to complete the project.
The purpose and format of the Project Proposal is as follows: The 496 projects already have stated tasks and goals. In your Project Proposal, you must demonstrate that you have both a clear understanding of these objectives and how you will achieve them. In particular, you must explain thoroughly your responsibilities throughout the project and acknowledge the level of commitment needed to see the project through to a successful conclusion. You should consider the Project Proposal to be a contract between you and your Technical Supervisor in which you specify: 
What you are to do
How you are to do it
Who else might be involved
What you will need to do it

Pattern your Project Proposal as a memo using the following headings:

Re: Project Proposal

In complete sentences and coherent paragraphs, create the following sections. Do not rely excessively on point or list form. Double space your work and use a size 12 font. Limit your Project Proposal to 2 pages, double spaced, one side of the page only. 
Introduction

Briefly describe your project, why you chose it, and what you hope to have learned by the end of it. Preview the remainder of the Project Proposal, listing its primary headings in the order in which they occur. 
Project Objectives

Identify the projectâ€™s objectives and explain the tasks you will need to accomplish to realize these goals. 
Project Significance

Describe the significance of the project and any relevant history. If it is a continuation or extension of a previous project, explain how your current work is a part of it. If it is a group project, identify the other students involved. 
Project Requirements

Identify what you will need to accomplish the project. This may range from specific items such as tools or equipment to broader facilities such as lab time. 
Project Timeline

Create a Gantt chart in which you itemize task over time. Remember to give your chart a Figure name and number. 
Conclusion:

Indicate that you will expend the effort needed to complete the project successfully and on time.
