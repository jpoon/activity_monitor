Producing the individual formal project proposal is your first task. This is not supposed to be a timewasting bureaucratic effort but primarily an aid to you, possibly only a page or two in length. It allows you to think about what you can really achieve in the limited time available. The proposal should describe the objectives and specific tasks of the project, bearing in mind the course description "Project in electrical engineering or computer engineering involving design, experimental and/or computer simulation work". If you are part of a project team, ensure that your project description makes this point clear and that you describe your group's organisation and the specific tasks of all your group members. Include a Gantt chart that shows how you intend to schedule your time to complete the project.
The purpose and format of the Project Proposal is as follows: The 496 projects already have stated tasks and goals. In your Project Proposal, you must demonstrate that you have both a clear understanding of these objectives and how you will achieve them. In particular, you must explain thoroughly your responsibilities throughout the project and acknowledge the level of commitment needed to see the project through to a successful conclusion. You should consider the Project Proposal to be a contract between you and your Technical Supervisor in which you specify: 
- What you are to do
- How you are to do it
- Who else might be involved
- What you will need to do it
