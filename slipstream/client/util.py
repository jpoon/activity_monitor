    the thread that gets the signal is waiting, the signal
    is ignored (which is a bug).

    The watcher is a concurrent process (not thread) that
    waits for a signal and the process that contains the
    threads.  See Appendix A of The Little Book of Semaphores.

    I have only tested this on Linux.  I would expect it to
    work on the Macintosh and not work on Windows.
